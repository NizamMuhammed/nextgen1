# NextGen Electronics Monorepo

This repository contains both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) for the NextGen Electronics e-commerce platform.

- `backend/` — Node.js REST API (Express, MongoDB-ready)

npm run dev
```

### Backend

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See each folder's README for more details.

## Documentation

Comprehensive API and frontend component guides are available in the [`docs`](docs/) directory.

## Backend Stack

The backend uses:

- **Express.js**: For building RESTful APIs
- **MongoDB** (via Mongoose): For database integration

You can start extending the backend by adding Express routes and MongoDB models in the `backend/` folder.
